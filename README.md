# Data Analysis Using Python - IBM Course Completion ðŸŽ‰  

## Overview  
This repository showcases my learning from the **Data Analysis Using Python** course offered by **IBM**. The course covered essential techniques for analyzing, visualizing, and interpreting data using **Python** and key libraries like **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**.  

## Key Learnings  
- Data wrangling and cleaning using **Pandas**  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with **Matplotlib & Seaborn**  
- Statistical analysis and hypothesis testing  
- Data aggregation and summarization  
- Working with real-world datasets for decision-making  

## Repository Contents  
- **Notebooks** â€“ Jupyter notebooks with hands-on exercises  
- **Projects** â€“ Real-world case studies applying Python for data analysis  
- **Datasets** â€“ Sample datasets used in the course  

## Tools & Technologies  
- **Python** â€“ Programming language for data analysis  
- **Pandas & NumPy** â€“ Data manipulation and numerical computations  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** â€“ Data visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** â€“ Interactive computing environment  

## Next Steps  
I plan to explore **machine learning** and **predictive analytics** using Python. Stay tuned for more updates and projects!
